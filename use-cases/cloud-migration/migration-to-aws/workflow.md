Here is a workflow for migrating an on-premises application to AWS using the architecture you described:

### **Phase 1: Preparation**

1. **Review and assess the on-premises application:**
    - Understand the application's architecture, data requirements, and usage patterns.
    - Identify any dependencies on other on-premises systems or infrastructure.
    - Evaluate the application's performance and scalability limitations.

2. **Plan the migration process:**
    - Determine the migration strategy, such as a lift-and-shift or replatforming approach.
    - Define the migration timeline and milestones.
    - Assign roles and responsibilities for the migration team.

3. **Set up AWS accounts and resources:**
    - Create an AWS account and configure IAM roles and permissions for the migration team.
    - Provision the necessary AWS services, such as S3, EFS, Lambda, and CloudWatch.
    - Establish network connectivity between the on-premises environment and AWS.

### **Phase 2: Data Transfer**

1. **Choose a data transfer method:**
    - For large datasets, use AWS Snowball or AWS DataSync for secure and efficient data transfer.
    - For smaller datasets, use S3 Transfer Utility or other file transfer tools.

2. **Initiate data transfer:**
    - Package the application data onto AWS Snowball devices or configure AWS DataSync for data transfer.
    - Monitor the data transfer progress and troubleshoot any issues.

3. **Validate data integrity:**
    - Verify that the transferred data is complete and intact upon arrival in AWS S3.
    - Perform data integrity checks to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

### **Phase 3: Application Deployment**

1. **Provision EC2 instances:**
    - Launch EC2 instances to host the application components.
    - Configure network security groups and access rules for the EC2 instances.
    - Ensure proper communication between the EC2 instances and AWS storage services.

2. **Deploy the application:**
    - Install and configure the application software on the EC2 instances.
    - Update application configurations to utilize AWS storage services instead of on-premises storage.
    - Perform application testing and validation to ensure proper functionality.

3. **Mount EFS file system:**
    - Mount the EFS file system to the EC2 instances to provide a shared file system structure.
    - Configure access permissions for the application to read and write data from the EFS file system.

### **Phase 4: Automation and Monitoring**

1. **Implement AWS Lambda for automation:**
    - Develop Lambda functions to automate tasks such as scaling EFS and EC2 resources.
    - Trigger Lambda functions based on defined criteria, such as application usage or performance metrics.
    - Utilize Lambda to automate data transfer processes using Snowball or DataSync.

2. **Set up CloudWatch monitoring:**
    - Configure CloudWatch metrics and alarms for application performance, storage utilization, and resource usage.
    - Define notification mechanisms to alert the migration team of any issues or performance bottlenecks.
    - Implement automated responses to alarms, such as scaling EFS or EC2 resources based on usage patterns.

### **Phase 5: Go-Live and Ongoing Operations**

1. **Cutover to AWS environment:**
    - Switch application traffic from the on-premises environment to the AWS environment.
    - Monitor application performance and resource utilization during the cutover process.
    - Address any issues or performance bottlenecks promptly.

2. **Decommission on-premises infrastructure:**
    - Once the AWS environment is stable and fully functional, decommission the on-premises infrastructure.
    - Ensure that all data and applications have been successfully migrated to AWS.
    - Remove any unused network configurations or dependencies on the on-premises environment.

3. **Ongoing operations and maintenance:**
    - Monitor the AWS environment and application performance on an ongoing basis.
    - Perform regular backups of application data and configurations.
    - Apply security patches and updates promptly to maintain a secure and up-to-date environment.
