#### Problem Statment:
A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that scales automatically. is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead

#### Solution:
For this scenario, an effective solution would involve leveraging AWS services to meet the scalability, high availability, and operational efficiency requirements. Here's an architecture that addresses the company's needs:

1. **AWS S3 for File Storage:**
   - Use Amazon S3 to store the application output files, as it offers highly scalable, durable, and available object storage with virtually unlimited capacity.
   - Configure lifecycle policies to automatically transition older files to cheaper storage tiers like S3 Infrequent Access or Glacier to minimize costs.

2. **AWS Snowball or AWS DataSync for Data Transfer:**
   - In the case of large on-premises data sets, use AWS Snowball or AWS DataSync for fast and secure data transfer to AWS.

3. **AWS EFS for File System Structure:**
   - Utilize Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) to provide a fully managed, scalable file storage service that supports standard file system interfaces. EFS offers seamless scalability and can automatically grow to petabyte scale.

   Mount the file system to an EC2 instance.
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t nfs ${ip_address}:/ /mnt/efs
   ```

4. **AWS Lambda for Automation:**
   - Employ AWS Lambda to automate the scaling and management of the application resources. Lambda can trigger operations based on defined criteria, ensuring the system can handle varying workloads with minimal manual intervention.
   - Using Webhooks or API notifications: Your on-premises application can send webhooks or API notifications to an endpoint hosted on AWS Lambda. These notifications will trigger a Lambda function, which can then initiate the data transfer process using Snowball or DataSync.

5. **Amazon CloudWatch for Monitoring:**
   - Implement Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of the application and storage services. Configure alarms and automated responses to ensure high availability and timely remediation of issues.

By implementing this AWS architecture, the company can achieve a highly scalable, available, and low operational overhead solution for migrating their on-premises application to the cloud.
