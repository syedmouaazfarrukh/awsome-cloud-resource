**Real-World Problem:**
*Legacy Monolithic Application in a Financial Institution*

A financial institution relies on a legacy monolithic application for core banking services. The application, developed decades ago, lacks the agility and flexibility needed to adapt to modern banking requirements. Introducing new features, updating compliance protocols, and addressing security vulnerabilities within the monolith pose significant challenges.

**Solution:**
*Microservices Modernization for Financial Services*

**Problem Statement:**
- **Existing State:** The financial institution operates on a monolithic architecture, making it difficult to respond quickly to changing regulatory requirements, introduce new financial products, and scale specific banking services independently.
- **Challenges:** The monolithic system is resistant to change, leading to delays in compliance updates, hindering innovation, and risking security vulnerabilities associated with outdated technology.

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Microservices Architecture:** Decompose the monolithic application into microservices, each responsible for a specific banking functionality (e.g., account management, transactions, compliance checks, customer authentication).
- **Containerization:** Utilize containerization technologies like Docker to encapsulate each microservice and its dependencies, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.
- **API Integration:** Establish well-defined APIs for communication between microservices, allowing them to interact seamlessly and ensuring data consistency.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Implement an event-driven architecture to enable asynchronous communication between microservices, facilitating real-time updates and responsiveness.
- **DevOps Practices:** Adopt DevOps practices for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automated testing to streamline the development and deployment of microservices.

**Benefits:**
- *Agility:* Microservices enable the financial institution to respond swiftly to regulatory changes, introducing new features and financial products independently.
- *Scalability:* Each banking service can be scaled independently based on demand, optimizing resource utilization.
- *Security:* Updating and securing individual microservices is more manageable, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities associated with outdated technology.
- *Innovation:* The modular nature of microservices allows for innovation, experimentation, and the adoption of modern technologies without overhauling the entire system.

**Estimated Costs/Quotas:**
- Costs are associated with AWS services such as Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS for container orchestration, along with usage-based pricing for other AWS services.
- Microservices architecture allows for cost optimization by scaling specific banking services as needed, avoiding unnecessary resource allocation.

**Step by Step Implementation:**
1. **Service Decomposition:** Identify and decompose distinct banking functionalities within the monolithic application into microservices.
2. **Containerization:** Containerize each microservice using Docker, ensuring consistency and independence as given in `use-cases\containers\microserv-for-financial-apps\microservices-app`.
3. **Push to AWS ECR:** Push Docker Images to ECR.
4. **ECS Task Definition:** Create Task Definition of each image from ECR separately using the following syntax:

```yaml
# ECS Task Definition for Account Management Service
account-management-task:
  containers:
    - name: account-management-container
      image: account-management-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

# ECS Task Definition for Transactions Service
transactions-task:
  containers:
    - name: transactions-container
      image: transactions-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8081

# ECS Task Definition for Compliance Checks Service
compliance-checks-task:
  containers:
    - name: compliance-checks-container
      image: compliance-checks-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8082

# ECS Task Definition for Customer Authentication Service
customer-authentication-task:
  containers:
    - name: customer-authentication-container
      image: customer-authentication-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8083
```


5. **Create/Deploy on ECS Cluster:** Create and deploy ECS cluster containing the above task definitions.

**Conclusion:**
By modernizing the legacy monolithic application into a microservices architecture with containerization, the financial institution gains the agility needed to adapt to changing regulatory requirements, enhance security, and introduce innovative banking services efficiently. The modular and scalable nature of microservices addresses the challenges posed by the rigid monolithic architecture.
