### Leverage Batch Processing for ETL Jobs on AWS

#### Problem Statement:

An e-commerce company receives a large volume of daily transaction data that needs to be processed and loaded into a data warehouse for analytics. The current process relies on traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs running on a fixed schedule, which results in occasional performance bottlenecks and delays during peak times.

#### Existing State:

The current ETL process is handled by a monolithic application running on a single server. The system struggles to cope with the increasing volume of daily transactions, leading to slower processing times and occasional job failures. Scaling the existing infrastructure to handle peak loads is both time-consuming and resource-intensive.

#### Proposed Solutions:

### Solution 1: Containerized Batch Processing with Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

**Description:**
Containerize ETL jobs and deploy them on Amazon ECS. This allows for efficient packaging, rapid scaling, and dynamic resource allocation based on demand.

**Advantages:**
- **Scalability:** Easily scale the number of containers to handle varying workloads.
- **Isolation:** Each ETL job runs in its own container, ensuring resource isolation and fault tolerance.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Containers share the underlying infrastructure, maximizing resource utilization.

**Estimated Costs/Quotas:**
- Costs are based on the number of containers and their resource usage (CPU, memory).
- AWS provides a free tier for ECS, covering a certain amount of container and task resources.
- Additional costs may include data transfer and storage for processed data in Amazon S3 or a data warehouse.
