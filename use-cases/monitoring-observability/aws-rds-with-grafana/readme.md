# Monitoring AWS RDS with Grafana

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up Grafana to monitor Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS). By following this guide, you'll be able to visualize and analyze important metrics to ensure optimal performance and reliability of your RDS instances.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. An active AWS account with RDS instances you want to monitor.
2. Grafana installed and configured on a server or a suitable platform.
3. Access to your AWS console with the necessary permissions to create IAM roles and access CloudWatch metrics.

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Grafana

Follow the official Grafana installation guide to set up Grafana on your chosen platform: [Grafana Installation Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/)

### Step 2: Configure Data Source

1. Open Grafana in your web browser.
2. Log in using your credentials.
3. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) in the left sidebar to access the main menu.
4. Select "Data Sources" and click on "Add your first data source."
5. Choose "CloudWatch" from the list of available data sources.
6. Configure the CloudWatch data source with your AWS credentials.

### Step 3: Create a Dashboard

1. In Grafana, click on the "+" icon in the left sidebar.
2. Choose "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on "Add new panel" to add a new panel.
4. In the panel settings, select your CloudWatch data source and choose the appropriate metric and dimensions for your RDS instance.
5. Customize the visualization options and repeat the process to add additional panels for different metrics.

### Step 4: IAM Role for CloudWatch

Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to access CloudWatch metrics:

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name Grafana-CloudWatch-Role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

Ensure the "trust-policy.json" file contains the appropriate trust relationship.

### Step 5: Attach Policies to IAM Role

Attach the following policies to the IAM role:

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name Grafana-CloudWatch-Role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess
```

### Step 6: Add IAM Role to Grafana

In the Grafana EC2 instance, configure the IAM role:

```bash
echo 'export AWS_REGION=<Your AWS Region>' >> /etc/default/grafana-server
echo 'export GF_CLOUDWATCH_ACCESS_KEY=<Your IAM Role Access Key>' >> /etc/default/grafana-server
echo 'export GF_CLOUDWATCH_SECRET_KEY=<Your IAM Role Secret Key>' >> /etc/default/grafana-server
```

### Step 7: Restart Grafana

Restart the Grafana service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo service grafana-server restart
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up Grafana to monitor AWS RDS using CloudWatch metrics. Customize your dashboards to visualize the metrics that matter most to your environment.
