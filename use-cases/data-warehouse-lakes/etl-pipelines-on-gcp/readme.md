**Industry Level Use-Case Problem:**

A large retail company collects vast amounts of data from various sources, including customer transactions, point-of-sale systems, social media, and online reviews. The company wants to consolidate this data into a centralized data warehouse to analyze customer behavior, identify trends, and improve its marketing and sales strategies. However, the company's current data infrastructure is struggling to handle the volume and complexity of the data, and it is difficult to access and analyze the data in a timely manner.

**Cloud Solution on GCP:**

To address this challenge, the retail company can migrate its data warehouse to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP offers a range of cloud services that can help the company collect, store, process, and analyze its data efficiently and effectively.

The following GCP services can be used to solve this use-case:

1. **Google Cloud Dataflow:** A fully managed cloud service for building and running Apache Beam pipelines. Apache Beam is a unified programming model for defining and executing data processing tasks, including ETL (extract, transform, load) and data analytics. Dataflow can handle the massive data volumes and processing requirements of the retail company.

2. **Google Cloud BigQuery:** A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse that allows the company to store, query, and analyze its data in a secure and scalable way. BigQuery can handle the complex data queries required by the retail company to analyze customer behavior and identify trends.

3. **Google Cloud Pub/Sub:** A fully managed real-time messaging service that allows the company to ingest data from various sources and stream it into Dataflow for processing. Pub/Sub can handle the high-volume and low-latency data streams generated by the retail company's point-of-sale systems and online reviews.


**Steps to implement Solution:**

- Run `epg-pubsub.py` after changing the variable names of `topic_id`, `subscription_id`, `project_id`.
- Run `epg-bigquery.py`.
- Run `epg-dataflow`
